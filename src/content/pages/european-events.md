Being a part of AEGEE-Barcelona allows you to take part in European events. These are handled through the [my.aegee.eu](https://my.aegee.eu) website.

There are many types of events happening throughout the continent. Other than the ever-popular [Summer Universities](summer-universities), there are also _Cultural events_, as well as other more "official" events. The full calendar is in the [AEGEE website](https://my.aegee.eu/calendar); from there you can also apply to events while their application period is open (remember that you need to [be a member](become-a-member) of an AEGEE Antenna first).

## Cultural events

These are the most common type of events that happen throughout the year. Think of them as small Summer Universities, where AEGEE Antennas will independently organize "small" events in their respective cities, that usually last from 3 to 5 days and include cultural visits and activities, parties, ice-breaking games and lots and lots of fun!

Of course, expect a team of motivated organizers and helpers to always be there if anything happens, and ensuring you get the best deals in accommodation, food and other services.

If you have any doubt about the event, you can directly contact the organizers; or you can also let us know, it's likely that some of our more experienced members have already been to previous events there, or know some of the organizers, so we can give you recommendations!
