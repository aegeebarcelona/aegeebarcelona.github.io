Young people across Europe come together to develop themselves, develop AEGEE or their Locals all the while having fun and making new friends. Being a part of AEGEE-Barcelona allows you to take part in European events. These are handled through the [my.aegee.eu](https://my.aegee.eu) website.

There are many types of events happening throughout the continent. Other than the ever-popular [Summer Universities](summer-universities), there are also _Cultural events_, as well as other more "official" events. The full calendar is in the [AEGEE website](https://my.aegee.eu/calendar); from there you can also apply to events while their application period is open (remember that you need to [be a member](become-a-member) of an AEGEE Antenna first).

## Cultural events

These are the most common type of events that happen throughout the year. Think of them as small Summer Universities, where AEGEE Antennas will independently organize "small" events in their respective cities, that usually last from 3 to 5 days and include cultural visits and activities, parties, ice-breaking games and lots and lots of fun!

Of course, expect a team of motivated organizers and helpers to always be there if anything happens, and ensuring you get the best deals in accommodation, food and other services.

If you have any doubt about the event, you can directly contact the organizers; or you can also let us know, it's likely that some of our more experienced members have already been to previous events there, or know some of the organizers, so we can give you recommendations!

## European Events

European Events events are organised by one or more AEGEE Locals and/or other bodies of AEGEE. They are announced at least two months before their organisation and appear in the Calendar of Events after being approved by the CD. These events are open to all AEGEE members and possibly also for non-members. Apart from accommodation, the fee includes also breakfast and one additional meal per day. The fee has to be as low as possible. 

### Network meetings (NWM)

It's a gathering that's all about fostering community, sharing insights, and keeping the momentum going.

What to Expect:
* Meeting a lot of people from your Network Area (our area is called La Nave and it envolves mostly Spanish Atennas)
* Sharing best practice between Antennas
* Learn about how other locals work (how they do PR, events, trips...)
* Collaborate with other aegeeans, develop new ideas and more

### Regional Training Course (RTC)

RTCs are all about honing in on and improving the specific skills considered most crucial for members in the area.

What to Expect:
* Meeting a lot of people from your Network Area
* Attending workshops and trainings by other aegeean trainers
* Debate sessions about specific and modern topics

### Summer Universities

Summer Universities (SU) are events happening during the summer period. They take place all over the continent, stretching from Russia to Spain and from Cyprus to the UK. Summer Universities are organised by Locals and last from 6 days to 4 weeks. During an SU the participants dive into a new culture, learn about a specific topic or get to know new places: Exploring the multicultural dimension of the European Continent. 

Check [Summer Universities](summer-universities) to learn more.

## Statutory events

### Agora

The Agora (General Assembly) is the highest decision-making body of AEGEE. It is held twice a year (in Spring and in Autumn). It has legislative power (creating and enforcing rules), representative power (electing and representing the Network) and controlling power (checking Activity Reports).  

What to expect in an Agora:
* You can go as a Delegate (you must attend most of the Talks and you must vote) or as Visitor (you are free to enter/leave all talks but you can't either vote or attend voting sessions)
* Voting new rules (like a real parliament)
* Voting upon the future development of the association
* Deciding about modifying the Statutes of AEGEE-Europe (AEGEE constitution)
* Electing the members of the Comité Directeur (the team that coordinates and represents AEGEE above all Antennas).
* Huge parties, Agoras usually host between 300-700 people

### European Planning Meeting (EPM)

The EPM is a Statutory Event and the largest annual thematic conference in AEGEE that takes place in February or March. The EPM consists of two parts: a thematic part and planning part. During the thematic part numerous sessions, workshops and discussions will be facilitated about a topic that was elected at the preceding Spring Agora. The planning part is used to draft the Action Agenda for the upcoming planning year. The EPM does not have any decision-making power.

What to expect:
* Different topic every year
* Wide variety of workshops, discussions and presentations about the topic of the EPM
* Sessions range from workshops for 20 people to panel discussions open for all 300 participants
* Interesting workshops given by qualified speakers and facilitators
* Help define short-term goals for the whole organisation (Action Agenda)

### Strategic Planning Meeting (SPM)

The SPM is the Statutory event during which the first draft of AEGEE’s Strategic Plan is created. It takes place every three years, at least six weeks before the Agora in which the new Strategic Planning is to be approved.

## Thematic projects

Some of AEGEE’s aims are easier to achieve by creating dedicated projects for them: these projects, while fulfilling their aims give birth to discussions, publications and events closely related to a well-defined topic. There are two types of projects in AEGEE: 

### Europe On Track (EoT)

Europe on Track is a youth-led project where ambassadors divided in teams and travel across Europe for one whole month by train, capturing the vision of young people about their future perspectives. 

They create materials, photographs and videos, and conduct interviews, all the while providing learning opportunities by organising training workshops based on the methodology of Non-Formal Education. The project engages hundreds of people throughout different local events and vox pop interviews.

Check [their official website](https://www.europeontrack.org/) for more information.

### Y Vote

Project designed as a campaign to encourage young people in Europe to make informed choices at in the European Elections. The project believes that young people play a crucial role in the future of Europe. Hence, they need to make an informed choice when voting and mobilise others to actively participate in their community.

Check [their official website](https://yvote.eu/) for more information.
