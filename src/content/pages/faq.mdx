> Example of FAQs from London (replaced London with Barcelona :) We should do our own. There are already some at [https://www.aegeebarcelona.org/contacto](https://www.aegeebarcelona.org/contacto).

### New members

**How old can I be to join AEGEE-Barcelona?**

You need to be 18-40 years old to join us in local events or to apply for European events. If you're 17 years old and you want to apply to a Summer University you can join us and attend the SU as long as you're 18 when the SU is happening. Allowed age ranges vary between antennas. For AEGEE-Barcelona is 18-40 but it could be different for other antennas.

**Do I need to be university student to join AEGEE-Barcelona?**

No, you don't need to be current or former university student to join us. AEGEE-Barcelona has no qualification requirements. Nevertheless, for your information we tell you that at AEGEE-Barcelona most of us are former university students and current workers. On other antennas around Europe the most common type of member is university student.

**Can I join AEGEE-Barcelona even if I don't live in Barcelona or I cannot attend any local event?**

Yes, you can. It doesn't matter where you live or whether you join us just for the European events like Summer Universities. Just click here to join us. You're more than welcome!

### Activities

**What have to do Summer Universities with real universities?**

Nothing. It's just a somewhat misleading name for a two-week summer camp for adults full of cultural activities. The kind of activities you'll enjoy during a Summer University (abbreviated as SU) is travelling, languages, workshops, cooking and, of course, party. You don't need to be university student to attend a SU. The reason for these events being called in this way is that thanks to the SU cultural program you will learn many things (like at university) during summer time.

**When do you organise the next event or gather together?**

All the activities we do, whether they are social drinks, day trips or exchanges are published on our Facebook page as an event. We also share the event on our AEGEE-Barcelona Activities Facebook group. So the best thing you can do to not miss any event is to join that group. You'll receive a notification every time we create a new event.

### Visiting Barcelona

**I'm from another antenna and I'm coming to Barcelona soon. Could you host me?**

AEGEE-Barcelona is a small antenna. Unlike other antennas around Europe which may offer some help for visiting aegeeans we don't have deals or agreements with hostels or university dormitories. Instead send us a message to ask whether we could host you.

**I'm from another antenna and I'm coming to Barcelona soon. Would you like to meet with me?**

Of course! Publish a post on our AEGEE-Barcelona Activities group so that everyone knows you're coming. If you don't want to make your visit so public you can drop us a private message.

### About AEGEE-Barcelona

**Which social networks do you use?**

At the moment we only use Facebook (Activities group) and Instagram. Previously we also used Twitter, Google+ and Flickr but all these accounts are now closed or outdated.


**What's the legal status of AEGEE-Barcelona?**

Under English law we're constituted as an unincorporated association (more on Wikipedia). More simply, we're a student organisation (most of us are or have been students). However you don't need to be student to join us. At the moment we aren't registered as student society with any student's union nor linked to any university.


**Do you have physical offices?**

No, we haven't got any space to be our headquarters. Every time the board meets we do it online, or in some board member's house, or even better, in a pub, as good British habits dictate. What a better way to hold sessions and take tough decisions than by drinking a pint of beer!


**Are you present at some Barcelona university?**

When we were funded in early 2013 we had board members studying at University of Hull and LSE, and we got support from some of their teachers [1, 2]. Since then we haven't been present at any Barcelona university.

But how is it possible that a student organisation has no presence on its natural environment? We've always struggled to settle in British universities. Also AEGEE isn't exclusively a student organisation. We accept anyone who has already finished studies and has become worker. We also accept members with no university education at all.

At AEGEE-Barcelona we're mostly former university students who have become workers. It would be nice to have more students among our members though. You won't find any AEGEE leaflet or poster at a Barcelona faculty but if you're a student you and your friends are very welcome to join us! You'll enjoy our activities with people from all around Europe.


**Where does the antenna get funds from?**

At the moment our only source of income are members' fees. So far we haven't organised any fundraising events like parties or trips. We don't have either sponsorship agreements with companies or universities. The activities we organise require the member to pay their own expenses (mainly train and club tickets, and food and drinks). We hope that in the future this will change and we'll be able to organise fundraising events.


**What are the funds used for?**

We don't have many funds, but we don't have many expenses either. The main expense we have is the payment we have to do twice a year before each Agora to AEGEE-Europe. This payment is proportional to the number of members we have, to our members' fee and to the number of people who applied to Summer Universities from our antenna.

All our finances are audited by the Audit Commission of AEGEE-Europe through a yearly financial report that needs to be approved by this commission in order to us continuing being an antenna within the AEGEE network. We have a bank account with Barclays and an account on PayPal.

For the year 2020 we've published a Transparency Report with information about our bank and PayPal accounts.
