AEGEE-Barcelona was founded in the _Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona_ in 1986, even though it started to operate in a stable manner in 1991. Since then it handled the welcome program of the international students of that university; a task that during some period was also extended to the other public universities in Barcelona: _Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya_, _Universitat Pompeu Fabra_ and _Universitat de Barcelona_.

Historically, AEGEE-Barcelona has always been one of the most important AEGEE Antennas in Europe. In 1996 it became the third largest AEGEE body in Europe --only after Amsterdam and Budapest-- with 540 members.

The Spring Agora of 1999 (probably the most important yearly AEGEE statutory event) took place in Barcelona. Many people consider it to be [the best Agora ever](https://www.aegeegoldentimes.eu/and-the-winner-is-barcelona/)! The European Planning Meeting (EPM) of 2020 --also one of the biggest and most important official AEGEE events, that takes place yearly-- was [organized in Barcelona](https://www.aegeegoldentimes.eu/epm-barcelona-2020/).

However, the lockdown due to the pandemic, that happened shortly after EPM, took a big toll in our association, that is build upon in-person activities and international travel, and the number of members and events plummeted.

Nowadays we are on the charge again, organizing regularly local activities and international events (the [2024 BarceLoca event](https://my.aegee.eu/events/barceloca-unleash-the-city) was the first international event since then, and a big success!). We are still far behind the numbers of pre-COVID times, but slowly getting there. Are you ready to be part of the AEGEE-Barcelona renaissance?
